STRUCTURE

This directory contains a corpus of sentences annotated using Universal Dependencies annotation.
The corpus comprises 254,830 words and 16,622 sentences, taken from various web media including
weblogs, newsgroups, emails, reviews, and Yahoo! answers; see the LDC2012T13 documentation for 
more details on the source of the sentences.  The trees were automatically converted into Stanford
Dependencies and then hand-corrected to Universal Dependencies.  All the dependency annotations
have been single-annotated, and a limited portion of them have been double-annotated with
interannotator agreement at approximately 96%.  

This file is compatible with the CoNLL-U format defined for Universal Dependencies. See:
http://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/format.html . However, at present the files do not
include lemmas or morphological features for words. These may be added in a later release.  

The dependency taxonomy can be found on the Universal Dependencies web site:
